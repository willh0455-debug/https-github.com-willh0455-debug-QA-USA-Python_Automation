# QA-USA-Python_Automation
### Automated Web Testing with Python, Selenium WebDriver, and Pytest

This repository contains automated test scripts written in Python as part of my QA Engineering training.  
The project demonstrates the fundamentals of **web UI automation**, including browser control, form interaction, validation testing, and framework setup using Selenium WebDriver and Pytest.

This repo reflects real QA automation skills used in industry: clean code structure, modular design, reusable test data, and proper environment configuration.
